## 🔔 About EchoTasks  

**EchoTasks** is not just another task manager — it’s a **Voice Task Manager Alarm App**.  
Along with **deadline notifications**, it also **speaks the task title aloud** at the deadline using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**.  

👉 Example: Set a reminder for *“Submit Assignment”* at 10 PM.  
At 10 PM, EchoTasks will:  
1. Show a notification 📝  
2. **Speak aloud:** *“Submit Assignment”* 🗣️  

This makes EchoTasks your **personal voice alarm for tasks**.
